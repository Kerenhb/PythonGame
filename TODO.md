# TODO
## Map
* Add a basic map, where you can define what rooms are next to each other
    * Perhaps a basic 2d array type thing?
* As well as what room the player is currently in

## Room (location?)
* Add ability to move in each compass direction (N/E/W/S), obviously first checking there is a room there

## Object
* Add basic object class, should have at least:
    * name
    * initial location
    * current location
* As well as what it can interact with?

### Player
* The player can probably just be an object?
