# Create
* Could make it so that every door can be un/locked 
  * Maybe add a link class or something to ensure that both sides are unlocked
  * not really relevant for getting out though, so could just make an exception for the front door

## Create my game (separate file)
* With rooms, etc
* Add object interactions as needed
* Add an objective, mentioned at the start with a command to remind you of it
  perhaps it could change as you progress (hints?)
* Win condition could be to get outside (check player location is outside, which will be a room)
    * and to do that you need to unlock a door (which needs a key, that could be hidden in a book 
    * that you need to examine).

# Misc Thoughts
* Could add Examine (x) - provides a specific description of something present in the room or that 
  the player is carrying, e.g. revealing 

* How to do object interactions?
  * Could have different states within the room or object (e.g. door locked or not)

* Could add some sort of map?
